fsq_AVnO0fVQSAjC-p3JnZsN	Pizza was nice but topping a bit sparse, beers were cold, price what you would expect. Little Chinese waiter works really hard while the other waiter spent 1.5 hours on the phone ignoring customers!
fsq_AVnO0ffKSAjC-p3JnZsY	Pizza is solid, but not amazing.
fsq_AVnO069pSAjC-p3JnZuV	Lovely food, nice dishes and affordable price, even though it's not really modern in its outlook it absolutely worths a visit...
fsq_AVnO06-GSAjC-p3JnZua	Homemade pasta
fsq_AVnO0hvsSAjC-p3JnZtI	Nice place, not the best place to try pasta at Rome. The place is clean, free internet.
fsq_AVnO0jOqSAjC-p3JnZts	Sub par food...
fsq_AVnO0iEZSAjC-p3JnZto	The staff was very kind but the food ... Very small portion from lasagne, which was cold, and the minestrone we received was not good. I ordered a cheese cake as well, but I could not eat it.
fsq_AVnO1A1zSAjC-p3JnZug	Both of their restaurants are great (Indian affair) but this was some how even better. The mint chicken, seekh kebabs and the garlic chicken starters are great. Great service.
fsq_AVnO1A2LSAjC-p3JnZuk	Awesome and authentic food. Try samosa, Kadhai paneer and garlic naan. Near to Manzoni metro station.
fsq_AVnO1LZiSAjC-p3JnZvX	Just usual pizzeria with usual menu and usual prices (6-8€ for pizza). Nothing special.
fsq_AVnO1CG7SAjC-p3JnZu8	Very good pizza with zuccha flowers, good house wine. Pleasant staff and atmosphere. While we were there many people ordered pizza to take away.
fsq_AVnO1CHISAjC-p3JnZu-	You must try the homemade tiramisu! It's excellent!
fsq_AVnO1CHnSAjC-p3JnZvE	Very good homemade tiramisu!
fsq_AVnO1K6-SAjC-p3JnZvU	I adore it, really. Very tasty lasagna, tiramisu and cheese with ham as a starter. Thanks to the host and his mother who cooked it. We asked him to suggest a wine and his choice was just perfect.
fsq_AVnO2_K3SAjC-p3JnZxU	Worst restaurant in Roma ever. The staff was speaking of us in Italian, saying they  don't want to see us again, please leave, stupid tourists . This attitude we sow for another table of tourists too.
fsq_AVnO2-lCSAjC-p3JnZxD	Authentic food in a central location with great quality/price ratio
fsq_AVnO2b3ASAjC-p3JnZwu	Good food, reasonable prices, try Roman Tripes!
fsq_AVnO2b3LSAjC-p3JnZww	I will come back ... Always I come to Rome!!
fsq_AVnO2RCzSAjC-p3JnZwh	Quality Buffet lunch
fsq_AVnO2cL5SAjC-p3JnZwy	The kitchen is truly delicious. The place is freezing cold though. And the owner turns off the wifi if you stay too long. ;-)
